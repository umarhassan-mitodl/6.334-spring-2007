Course Meeting Times
--------------------

Lectures: 3 sessions / week, 1.0 hour / session

Description
-----------

6.334 examines the application of electronics to energy conversion and control. Topics covered include: modeling, analysis, and control techniques; design of power circuits including inverters, rectifiers, and DC-DC converters; analysis and design of magnetic components and filters; and characteristics of power semiconductor devices. Numerous application examples will be presented such as motion control systems, power supplies, and radio-frequency power amplifiers. The course is worth 6 engineering design points.

Prerequisite
------------

6.012

Homework
--------

Problem sets will be issued on a weekly basis, and will be due one week after issue unless otherwise specified. Late problem sets will not be accepted unless previously arranged with the TA. Good problems for 6.334 are very difficult to create, so you will sometimes be assigned a problem used in previous years. **Under no circumstances are you to use 6.334 "bibles" to help you with problem sets**. You may, however, consult with colleagues who are taking 6.334, or who have taken 6.334 in the past. For those of you without access to such colleagues, many graduate students in LEES have taken 6.334 and are willing to help answer questions if you can't arrange to see the TA or Prof. Perreault.

Quizzes
-------

There will be 2 quizzes in 6.334 this term. The tentative dates for these are due two days after Lec #19 and one day after Lec #34. The exams will be closed book and will be given during the evening, starting at 7:30 pm. There is no final exam.

Grading
-------

Grading will be based on three components:

The project will be issued in early April and tentatively due on Lec #37. As with the homework, consultation with colleagues is permissible, but you must hand in a unique, independently-completed solution.

Field Trip
----------

As part of the class, we will arrange a field trip to the power electronics design and manufacturing facility of [Synqor](http://www.synqor.com/) in Boxborough, MA. Synqor is a technology leader in DC/DC converters for telecommunications applications.
